# 0x00. AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description

This project is part of the AirBnB clone series, focusing on the back-end part
of the application. It introduces the first step towards building a full web
application: the command interpreter. This console is used to manage objects for
our AirBnB clone project, including operations such as creating new objects,
retrieving an object, doing operations on objects, updating attributes of an
object, and destroying objects.

## Installation
